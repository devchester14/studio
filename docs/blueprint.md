# **App Name**: OTT Cross-Platform Content Discovery

## Core Features:

- Unified Search: Develop a unified search that transcends platform boundaries to surface all relevant content.
- Seamless Access: Guide users to access content through seamless rental, purchase, or subscription options.

## Style Guidelines:

- Use a palette that is easy on the eyes, and suitable for long periods of use.
- Use a font that is easy to read at a variety of sizes.
- Simple, understandable icons for common actions such as play, pause, and stop.
- Clean, minimalist design with generous whitespace to focus attention on the content.
- Subtle transition effects, so that moving between the search results, or playing and pausing a video, has some nice polish.
